/* VersaLogic VersaAPI Sample Code - 20220126
*
* This code is given with no guarantees and is intended to be used as an 
* example of how to use the VersaAPI software package and to check the 
* operation post install. This code will work with various VersaLogic 
* single board computers.
*
* Default Program Description: 
* This application will report the VersaAPI library version number, and
* then run a 8254 Timer example that will count down from a specifed count.
* When 0 is reached an interrupt (56) will be generated and the counter
* will be reinitialized and started again.  This will continue until the 
* specifed number of interrupts are generated. Timing information is
* printed to the screen: time captured immedidiately before the timer
* is started, and immediately when the timer interrupt service routine
* is called. This allows for capturing real-time timing information for
* the timer count-down.
* 
* Command Line Options: 
* Run timer8254_InterruptExample -h for a list of command line options.
* 
* This code has been compiled and run using gcc on Ubuntu 18.04.03 LTS, 
* kernel 4.15.0-88-generic, with VersaAPI version 1.8.b.  A Linux
* compatible Makefile has been provided with this .c file for an example
* of how to compile this code. */
*
*
* Usage: 	make clean	=> Removes executable application and all 
*				   dependant .o files.
*		make 		=> Builds 'versaAPI_sample' application.
*
* Build fruit is an example application 'timer8254_InterruptExample' in the current directory.
*
* Example output:
